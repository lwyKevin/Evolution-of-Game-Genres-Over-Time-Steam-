What’s the most popular genre today?

You might think that big AAA studios like Ubisoft or Capcom create the most popular games. But the truth is different.

Indie games dominate in sheer volume—making up about 30% of all releases. AAA titles get more attention, but most new games come from small indie teams.

This shift is huge, isn’t it? Ten to twenty years ago, AAA dominated the market. Now, indie developers lead in quantity.

But why has the genre shifted?

Or 

**Why have game genres and themes changed over the past 20 years?**

**Are there emerging genres or themes that could be popular in the upcoming decade?**

That's what we want to find out.

We will look at data from Steam, which is one of the largest digital game distribution platforms in the world.

In this R project, we will use [SteamSpy](https://steamspy.com)

SteamSpy categorizes games on Steam into 11 genres: Action, Adventure, Early Access, Ex-Early Access, Free, Indie, MMO, RPG, Simulation, Sports, and Strategy.

Other data sources like [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/top-100/games), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games/data?select=steam.csv), and [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) also exist, but IGDB and SteamDB are difficult to scrape and don’t provide much of the important data;

Kaggle is somewhat outdated, having last been updated in 2019.

SteamSpy, on the other hand, offers more insights such as median player time, release date, and more.

This project is last updated on May 10th 2025, the May 15th is the date I upload this to github not the date of completion.

Answer to the questions:

Q1: Why have game genres and themes changed over the past 20 years?

A1: Expensive game engines free to public, everyone can be game devs + pour the heart, passionate -> quantity + quality 
The "pour their heart" part can be seen in [steam's overwhelmingly positive review](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41140195-Overwhelmingly-Positive-User-Reviews/), 2/3 are indie games, showing they got quality as well


Q2: Are there emerging genres or themes that could be popular in the upcoming decade?

A2: Indie genre steady and significant release, Early Access genre had grown notably in recent years despite being small increases.
